*Box office and foreign gross are giving varing results. It is however essential to consider both, however, for this case since are looking at global markets, considering box office typically represent the revenue generated by a movie in theaters within a specific country or region, itcan miss out on foreign revenues thus it is better to use foreign gross.

**Recommendations**
Based on the analysis conducted, the following recommendations are suggested for Microsoft's Video Content studio:
1. Focus on genres with demonstrated box office success. Upon leveraging insights from the top-performing genres, Drama and comedy proved to dominate in all ways, ratings, revenues, and did quite well in popularity.

2. Collaborate with experienced directors and writers associated with successful movies to ensure quality content production. Based on both domestic and foreign gross revenues, movie ratings and popularity, David Cronenberg and Kevin Smith stood out as the best performing writers and directors. A plus is they do both directorship and writing.

3. Monitor and adapt to emerging trends in movie ratings and audience preferences to stay competitive in the market. From the analysis we can see that the comedy and drama genre is gaining more popularity while action and adventure(animation-kids and family) sci-fi is losing popularity and having declines in revenues in the last two years. Microsoft should focus more on the Drama/Category.
